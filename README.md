# The project is still in the works, and I'd love your contributions. However, I recommend holding off on using the app for now. Thanks for your understanding!

## CrossWikiEditor

Hey there! I'm working on creating a cross-platform version of [AutoWikiBrowser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser). I'm using [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) for the user interface and [WikiClientLibrary](https://github.com/CXuesong/WikiClientLibrary) to connect with the MediaWiki API. The goal is to make it run seamlessly on Windows, Linux, and OSX (without needing Wine).
